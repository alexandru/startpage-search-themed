# Startpage.com Search — Themed

Simple extension that just installs [Startpage.com](https://www.startpage.com/) as a search engine in Firefox — with a "dark mode" compatible theme.

Needed because in Private Mode, cookies can't be remembered, so the search engine will always use the default theme, unless the theme is set via URL query parameters.

Install it in Firefox:

- [Black](https://addons.mozilla.org/ro/firefox/addon/startpage-search-black-theme/)
- [Dark](https://addons.mozilla.org/ro/firefox/addon/startpage-search-dark-theme/)
- [Night](https://addons.mozilla.org/ro/firefox/addon/startpage-search-night-theme/)
